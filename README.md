Overall Comments:

I am fairly new and unfamiliar with Solidity and Smart Contracts so Problems 5 and 6 are rather challenging to me. 
Nonetheless, the challenges were very interesting to me as I attempted to solve them with the help of documentation and crash course videos.

For Problem 5, I did not have the chance to test out my Balance Contract getBalances method to retrieve the token balances as I ran out of
test Goerli funds, but I believe that my logic for implementing the method is right. I tried deploying my Balance contract on the Goerli test
network to run my getBalances method, but I was faced with "Insufficient funds" error.
